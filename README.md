# Planet Plan-it 🪐
---

## Project #1 - Team 7  😎 Squirtle Squad

## Introduction: 

This application was built to help business events planners easily create a business event. It gives the user the ability to confirm the main details like Location, Food Catering, and the recommended Clothing and accessories for guests. The user is given a map for the area and a current weather outlook. After taking into account a few user inputs, the app will create an event outline. 

## Highlights:

The event planner was built using the Bulma CSS framework and a variety of API's. 
#
The following API's:
1. OpenWeather API
2. Arcgis Location API
3. Google Fonts API
